### About Me
 I am a hobbyist programmer, I prefer using C++, but I am fluent in C, Python, etc. I like backend, systems, and parallel programming. I have experience with Vulkan, OpenGL, and virtual reality. My current main project is Basalt, a rewrite of my old Vinegar Engine to use a job system, parallelism, Vulkan, and better design choices. I have been proficient in C++ since 2019. I develop on both Windows and Linux, and focus on code readability when writing.
