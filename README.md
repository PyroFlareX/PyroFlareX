### About Me
 I am a hobbyist programmer, I prefer using C++, but I am fluent in C, Python, etc. I like backend, systems, and parallel programming. I have experience with Vulkan, OpenGL, and virtual reality. My current main project is Basalt, a rewrite of my old Vinegar Engine to use a job system, parallelism, Vulkan, and better design choices. I have been proficient in C++ for about 3-4 years now. I develop on both Windows and Linux, and focus on code readability when writing. I am hoping to get involved in more collaborative projects and such. Currently looking for a programming internship for the summer to gain production experience in C/C++ software development if possible.
